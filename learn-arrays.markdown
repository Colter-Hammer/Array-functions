## Learn Array Functions

The purpose of this is to learn how array functions work and how to use them. Search each of the listed array functions in [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN). There are four questions for you to answer for each function. You will also write a real-world example to practice what you're learning. You should answer the questions as comments in your code. Once you've completed each ***set of code***, push it to your personal github account. 

 ### Questions to understand:
 
 1. What does it do?
 2. Does it edit the current array?
 3. What does it return?
 4. How can I use this?
