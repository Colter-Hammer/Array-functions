## Learn Array Methods

The purpose of this is to learn how array functions work and how to use them. Search each of the listed array functions in [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN). There are five things for you to answer or do for each function. You will also write a real-world example to practice what you're learning. You should answer the questions as comments in your code. Once you've completed each set of questions and code, push it to your personal github account. 

 ### Questions to understand:
 
 1. What does it do? make sure to explain the parameters.
 2. Does it edit the current array?
 3. What does it return?
 4. How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
 5. Build your real world example.
 
 
 ### The Methods To Learn
 
 1. [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)
 2. [pop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop)
 3. [shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift)
 4. [unshift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift)
 8. [sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) **Have an example both with and without a function**
 3. [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) **Understand object references and how they work with concat**
 2. [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)
 4. [includes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes)
 5. [every](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every)
 5. [some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some)
 3. [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
 6. [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
 7. [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
 8. Any other **3** functions you want
  * When you choose the 3 functions, try to choose functions that will challenge you. If you already know them, try to use them in a different context by making it more dynamic. Be creative. This is an opportunity to learn and show your new skills.
